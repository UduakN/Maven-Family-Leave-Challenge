# Challenge

As part of Women's History Month in the United States, your company is writing a piece on parental leave policies across the business world and they need you to create an impactful visual using the data you collected.

# About the Data
The dataset contains a csv table with 1,601 records, one for each company. Each record contains the company's name & industry, as well as crowdsourced information on the paid & unpaid weeks off they offer as part of both their maternity & paternity leave policies (when available)
